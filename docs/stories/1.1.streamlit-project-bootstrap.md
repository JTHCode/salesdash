# Story 1.1: Streamlit Project Bootstrap

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** project maintainer,
**I want** a Streamlit app scaffolded with modular Python packages and preloaded dataset utilities,
**so that** future analytics features plug into a clean, portfolio-ready structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository contains a Streamlit entrypoint, modular `src` packages, and configuration for local + Streamlit Cloud execution.
2. Kaggle sales dataset is stored locally, documented, and loaded via a reusable data access helper.
3. Basic page shell renders with placeholder sections for KPI, time-series, map, and forecast areas.
4. README describes setup, local run instructions, and deployment steps to Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Dependencies
- Story 0.1: Project Infrastructure Setup must be completed (status Done) to confirm scaffolded assets are stable before implementing Story 1.1.

## Project Structure Notes
- Architecture expects dataset stored as `data/sales_data.csv`; align by converting the Kaggle Excel source or updating loader paths consistently. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]
- Module namespaces (`components`, `services`, `utils`) must match architecture guidance to keep downstream imports stable. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Establish Streamlit entrypoint and module layout (AC1) [Source: architecture/streamlit-application-structure.md#main-app-apppy]
  - [x] Confirm `src/app.py` exists and configures page settings, sidebar filters, and component rendering stubs per architecture outline. (AC1, AC3) [Source: architecture/streamlit-application-structure.md#main-app-apppy]
  - [x] Ensure `src/components/`, `src/services/`, and `src/utils/` packages include `__init__.py` files and follow naming from the source tree. (AC1) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]
  - [x] Update `.streamlit/config.toml` with theme and server defaults aligned to deployment configuration. (AC1) [Source: architecture/deployment-configuration.md#streamlit-configuration-streamlitconfigtoml]
- [x] Implement reusable data access helper for Kaggle dataset (AC2) [Source: architecture/core-services-implementation.md#1-data-loader-data_loaderpy]
  - [x] Store Kaggle file under `data/raw/` and normalize to the architecture's expected CSV path or ensure loader handles Excel while emitting cached DataFrame. (AC2) [Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#data-flow]
  - [x] Provide `load_data()` and `get_filtered_data()` functions wrapped with `st.cache_data` for performant reuse. (AC2) [Source: architecture/core-services-implementation.md#1-data-loader-data_loaderpy]
  - [x] Document dataset provenance and loader usage in README. (AC2, AC4) [Source: architecture/deployment-steps.md#3-post-deployment]
- [x] Render placeholder dashboard regions in main app (AC3) [Source: architecture/streamlit-application-structure.md#main-app-apppy]
  - [x] Layout KPI, time-series, map, and forecast sections using component stubs to confirm routing. (AC3) [Source: architecture/visualization-components.md#visualization-components]
  - [x] Insert TODO comments linking to future stories for each component implementation. (AC3) [Source: architecture/visualization-components.md#visualization-components]
- [x] Update README with setup and deployment guidance (AC4) [Source: architecture/deployment-steps.md#deployment-steps]
  - [x] Document local environment setup, `streamlit run src/app.py`, and Streamlit Cloud deployment steps. (AC4) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#local-testing]
  - [x] List required Python versions and pinned dependency minimums. (AC4) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack]
- [x] Ensure baseline tests are ready for downstream stories (supports AC1-AC4) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-pytest]
  - [x] Keep pytest scaffolding under `tests/` updated to import new modules without failure. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-pytest]
  - [x] Add README note describing smoke-test flow before deployment. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#local-testing]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Not applicable - no prior epic stories have reached Done status yet; confirm Story 0.1 resolves outstanding review items before implementation.

### Data Models
- Sales dataset columns and types must match the defined Kaggle schema (customer, order, pricing, geographic fields) when loading into Pandas. [Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#data-model]

### API Specifications
- No external service APIs are required; Streamlit calls embedded Python modules directly. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#high-level-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- `components/kpi_cards.py`, `time_series.py`, `geographic_map.py`, and `forecasting_viz.py` act as rendering modules invoked from `app.py`; keep function signatures ready for future implementations. [Source: architecture/visualization-components.md#visualization-components]
- Main app should import data helpers and component stubs as outlined to establish consistent entry points. [Source: architecture/streamlit-application-structure.md#main-app-apppy]

### File Locations
- Maintain directory layout defined in the project structure (data, src, components, services, utils, tests) to support downstream imports. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Provide pytest scaffolding hooks (`tests/test_analytics.py`, `tests/test_forecasting.py`) and document local smoke tests via `streamlit run src/app.py`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Target Python 3.11+ with pinned versions for Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, scikit-learn, and include `openpyxl` for Excel ingestion. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack]
- Apply Streamlit theme and server configuration per `.streamlit/config.toml` guidance for consistent deployments. [Source: architecture/deployment-configuration.md#streamlit-configuration-streamlitconfigtoml]

## Testing
- Run `streamlit run src/app.py` locally to confirm placeholder layout renders without errors. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#local-testing]
- Maintain pytest placeholders ensuring imports succeed; expand with a basic assertion that `load_data()` returns a DataFrame. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-pytest]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
OpenAI GPT-5 (Codex)

### Debug Log References
- `pip install openpyxl` (command timed out but dependency installed successfully)
- `python -m pytest`

### Completion Notes List
- Streamlit entrypoint now mirrors architecture filters, renders placeholder components, and documents future story hand-offs.
- Data loader standardises column names, exports canonical CSV caches, and exposes filter helpers consumed by the UI and tests.
- README, config, and test suite updated so downstream stories have clear setup, smoke tests, and verified imports.
