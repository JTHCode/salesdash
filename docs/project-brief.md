## Project Brief: Sales Analytics Portfolio Dashboard

### Project Overview

A portfolio showcase project demonstrating data analysis and interactive visualization skills through a sales & profit analytics dashboard. Built with Python, Streamlit, and FastAPI to display proficiency for Data Analyst, Full-stack Developer, and ML Engineer roles.

### Target Audience

Potential employers evaluating candidates for:

-   Data Analyst positions
-   Full-stack Developer roles
-   ML Engineer opportunities

### Goals

**Primary Goal:** Demonstrate ability to build professional, interactive data dashboards that extract actionable business insights

**Success Criteria:** Employers viewing this project should conclude: "This candidate is efficient in building good-looking interactive data dashboards and using data analysis to extract key business insights"

### Core Features (MVP - Version 1)

**Priority Features:**

1.  **KPI Summary Cards**
    -   Total Revenue, Profit Margin, Growth Rate
    -   Period-over-period comparisons
    -   Visual indicators (up/down trends)
2.  **Time Series Analysis**
    -   Interactive date range filtering
    -   Sales and profit trends over time
    -   Drill-down by period (monthly/quarterly/yearly)
3.  **Geographic Performance Heatmap**
    -   Regional sales density visualization
    -   Interactive map with hover details
    -   Regional profit margin comparisons
4.  **ML Sales Forecasting** (Basic Implementation)
    -   Simple time-series forecasting (moving average or basic ARIMA)
    -   Forecast vs actual visualization
    -   Confidence intervals display

**Supporting Features:**

-   Responsive layout (desktop-optimized for portfolio viewing)
-   Clean, professional UI design
-   Fast load times with appropriate caching

### Technical Stack

-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Frontend:** Streamlit
-   **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
-   **Visualization:** Plotly, potentially Folium for maps
-   **ML:** scikit-learn or statsmodels (basic forecasting)
-   **Development:** Cursor IDE with Claude Code
-   **Data Source:** Kaggle Sales & Profit Dataset (static, clean)

### Technical Constraints

-   **No complex auth required** (portfolio piece)
-   **No database** (static dataset sufficient)
-   **No high-traffic optimization** (portfolio showcase)
-   **Clean data assumption** (minimal preprocessing needed)

### Post-MVP Enhancements (Version 2+)

-   Advanced ML models (Prophet, LSTM)
-   Customer segmentation analysis
-   Product performance deep-dive
-   Anomaly detection
-   Export capabilities (PDF reports)

### Success Metrics

-   Professional, polished UI that looks production-ready
-   Fast, responsive interactions
-   Clear demonstration of Python data skills
-   Working ML implementation (even if simple)
-   Clean, documented code in GitHub repo
