# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Deliver a sleek, data-storytelling dashboard that immediately surfaces health metrics while inviting deeper exploration. The experience should feel like a polished analytics product demo: rich visuals, intuitive structure, and smooth transitions that let recruiters or hiring managers evaluate skills without friction.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Card-first summary highlighting core KPIs at the top with trend arrows.
- Contextual filters (date range, metric focus) that instantly update charts.
- Tabbed or segmented layout separating time-series, geographic, and forecasting views.
- Hover tooltips and annotations that translate numbers into plain-language insights.

## Core Screens and Views
- Executive Overview (KPI cards + trend callouts)
- Time-Series Insights (line/area charts with forecasting overlay)
- Regional Performance (map heatmap with supporting table)
- Forecast Detail (model assumptions, confidence intervals, "what to watch" notes)
- Data & Methodology (brief explanation of dataset, preprocessing, forecasting approach)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Adopt AA-level contrast and text sizing so visualizations remain legible for varied viewers. Include alt text or captions for key charts to show accessibility intent, even if Streamlit limits full compliance.

## Branding
Modern, portfolio-appropriate theme anchored around a dark-neutral canvas with accent colors that align with sales analytics (greens for growth, reds for risk). Use consistent typography (e.g., pairing a sans-serif for body with a stronger display font for KPIs). Assumption: no existing corporate palette-confirm if you prefer a specific color system or if minimalist branding is acceptable.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary target is desktop browser (portfolio review setting) but layout should gracefully adapt to ~1024px width tablets. Mobile-specific optimization is optional given focus on hiring demos.
