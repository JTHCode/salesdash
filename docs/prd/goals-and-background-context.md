# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Showcase ability to build polished analytics dashboards that communicate actionable insights for business stakeholders.
- Demonstrate fluency with Python, Streamlit, and modular analytics code in an integrated data product.
- Highlight competency in time-series forecasting and translating models into intuitive visuals.
- Convey readiness for data analyst, full-stack developer, and ML engineer responsibilities.

## Background Context
The portfolio project targets hiring managers who need proof a candidate can transform a static sales dataset into an interactive decision-support tool. Leveraging Streamlit for rapid UI delivery with embedded Python analytics modules positions the dashboard as both a polished demo and a foundation for future scaling. The emphasis on KPI storytelling, geographic exploration, and lightweight forecasting shows range across analytics, frontend presentation, and applied ML without introducing unnecessary architectural overhead for a showcase artifact.

## Problem Statement
Hiring managers often discard resumes that lack tangible examples of analytics execution, forcing candidates to overexplain skills during interviews. Without a cohesive, interactive demonstration, it is hard to validate whether the candidate can extract insights from data, design usable dashboards, and communicate results. This project addresses that gap by providing a production-quality sales analytics dashboard that surfaces business outcomes within minutes.

## Target Audience
- Hiring managers and recruiters evaluating candidates for data analyst, full-stack developer, or ML engineer roles.
- Technical interviewers who need a reproducible artifact to explore a candidate's code quality and analytical thinking.
- Portfolio reviewers on GitHub or LinkedIn scanning for polished, interactive projects.

## Success Metrics
- Achieve at least 4 of 5 positive feedback scores ("clear insight","professional polish","would demo to team") from targeted hiring manager reviews.
- Secure 3+ interview callbacks or screening invites that specifically reference the dashboard within 30 days of release.
- Demonstrate dashboard load times under 2 seconds for core views and keep reviewer drop-off below 20% per analytics logs.

## Differentiation
Unlike generic sales dashboards that focus purely on static charts, this project bundles KPI storytelling, geographic exploration, and a forecast narrative in a single streamlined experience. It demonstrates end-to-end ownership-from data preparation to deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud-making it easier for evaluators to gauge both engineering and analytical maturity without provisioning infrastructure.
