# MVP Scope & Validation

## In Scope (MVP)
- KPI summary cards with trend indicators.
- Interactive time-series charts with interval toggles (monthly/quarterly/yearly).
- Geographic heatmap with hoverable regional performance details.
- Precomputed sales forecasting overlay with narrative explanation.
- Metric and filter controls shared across dashboard views.
- Data & Methodology page summarizing dataset provenance and modeling approach.

## Out of Scope / Deferred
- Advanced forecasting models (Prophet, LSTM, ensembles).
- Customer segmentation and cohort analysis.
- Product-level or SKU drill-down dashboards.
- Automated anomaly detection or alerting workflows.
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV) and scheduled reporting.

## MVP Validation Approach
- Share deployed dashboard with at least five hiring managers/recruiters and collect structured feedback on clarity, usefulness, and polish.
- Track interview callbacks or portfolio mentions referencing the project within 30 days of launch to confirm business impact.
- Monitor Streamlit analytics for load time (<2 seconds) and error-free sessions during demos; log remediation tasks if thresholds slip.
- Iterate copy, visuals, or interactions based on reviewer insights before promoting the project broadly.
