# Checklist Results Report
**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Checklist:** PM Requirements Checklist (comprehensive run)

| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PASS | Problem statement, audience, success metrics, and differentiation are now explicit. |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | In-scope, out-of-scope, and validation approach captured with rationale tied to goals. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PARTIAL | High-level direction defined; user flows, detailed error states, and feedback loops still pending. |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | FR list maps to MVP features with clear numbering and scope. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | Performance, documentation, and monitoring expectations articulated. |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | Epics sequential with well-formed stories and acceptance criteria sized for AI execution. |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PASS | Repository, runtime, monitoring cadence, and technical debt handling documented. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS | Data, integration, and operational considerations documented for architect handoff. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PARTIAL | Structure is clear, but user journey diagrams and stakeholder communication plan still outstanding. |

**Executive Summary**  
Overall completeness ~85%. MVP scope is confirmed as "just right" with supporting guardrails, and the document is ready for architectural planning once UX detail artifacts are produced.

**Top Issues by Priority**  
- HIGH: Document primary user flows (from landing through forecast exploration) and outline error/empty-state handling.
- MEDIUM: Add a lightweight stakeholder/communication plan plus glossary/terminology cues for non-technical reviewers.
- LOW: Include visual aids (information architecture diagram or screen map) to reinforce narrative flow.

**MVP Scope Assessment**  
Scope remains focused on demonstrating analytics craftsmanship without stretching into advanced ML or reporting. Keep the metric switching feature only if implementation effort stays manageable; otherwise, downgrade to a future enhancement.

**Technical Readiness**  
Technical constraints, deployment plan, and monitoring expectations are now documented. Key risk is ensuring Streamlit Community Cloud performance holds once visuals and forecasts are integrated; track load times during development and update caching strategy if needed.

**Recommendations**  
1. Produce user flow sketches or bullet-sequenced journeys and define error-state messaging for filtering and data load issues.  
2. Capture a stakeholder alignment note (e.g., self, mentors/reviewers) with cadence for sharing PRD updates.  
3. Add optional visual diagram illustrating dashboard layout to aid UX/Architect collaboration.  
4. Retain the checklist section for future runs; re-run after UX collateral and stakeholder plan are added to confirm full readiness.
